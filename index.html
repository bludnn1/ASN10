            <h1>Vicious Cycles</h1>
            <h2>Bikes</h2>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>We don’t just customize bikes. We also sell ready to go by order. Riding is a lifestyle, and we want to help you live your life in luxury.</p>
    <p>Vicious Cycles Inc is a Raleigh-based cycle workshop founded in late 2010. We hope to create bikes for all peoples needs or desiers.

    We believe that every machine should be an refextion of its owner. We believe in the significance of individualism. We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.
    
    You get on your bike, you ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, you overcome it all and you ride again. It’s a Vicious Cycle! So make it worth the while, don't just be part of the numbers. Ride your cycle, chase your dreams, live your life.</h2>
<h3>Customer Service and Satisfaction</h3>
<p>At Vicious Cycles, we are committed to providing the best customer service. From product selection and ordering to truly custom builds.</p>
<h4>How Can I Buy From Vicious Cycles?</h4>
<p>Vicious Cycle products can be purchased/ordered at our store. Come down today and we'll get started with a purchase of an existing bike with cash, credit, or an in-house loan approval.

    All custom builds will require a 25% down payment before projects will begin or a payment in full. All purchases on custom cycles are final.</p>
<h5>Trade Shows</h5>
<p>We exhibit at several trade shows every year.  We are at home in the indoor showroom, but we believe the real showroom can only be found out on and off the road. Cycling is a lifestyle- Live Your Life</p>
